# Data_Viz_ClimateChangeNHumans

The aim of the project is to understand and develop a framework to evaluate different visualizations.

Page 1 of the project defines what 'effective visualization' means and specifies the framework for evaluation.

A link is provided after the framework which takes the reader to another page which evaluates five visualizations based on the framework developed. For consistency, the topic of the visualization is common which is Climate Change.

Replication of Warming Stripes is done using python.
