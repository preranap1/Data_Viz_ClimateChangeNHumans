Title: Evaluation of Visualizations on Climate Change
---

# Evaluation Criteria

Visualizations are evaluated on a scale of 1 to 5. 

1 - Visualization completely misses on a particular criterion

2 - Visualization touches on the basic concept but is not able to do full justice

3 - Visualization covers some part of the framework but there is definitely room for improvement

4 - Some ambiguity but covers most of the requirements listed in the framework

5 - Visualization fulfills all requirements of particular criteria listed in the framework

_NOTE: Visualizations 1 and 5 are interactive. Including an image here will not do justice to them. Hence, links to these visualizations have been provided._

**Visualization 1**

[Bloomberg: What's really warming the world?](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-whats-warming-the-world/)


_Criteria_ | _Rating_
------------ | -------------
_It tells a story_ | 5
_Is tailored to an audience_ | 5
_Has a well-defined aim_ | 5
_Sets up a clear design framework_ | 5

**Overall Rating: 5**

The Bloomberg visualization does well in telling a story. The engaging content and narrative make the visualization memorable to the reader. It is interactive and is broken down in a way that keeps the reader interested. The audience of this visual would be the readers of Bloomberg Businessweek. Considering that they could be from different walks of life, the creators of the visualization have done a good job to explain concepts using simple words. We do not see many jargons. Short and precise copy over each graph explains what is happening perfectly. Furthermore, this visualization is data-driven. Information about the data can be found in the explanation that follows the graphs. It aims to answer some questions and does a very good job of providing convincing arguments. The designer follows design principles which makes the end product (the visualization) consistent in terms of design. Visual Hierarchy is maintained. The reader is first drawn to the question which is clearly answered by the graphs that follow. Interactivity in the graph lines further enhances user experience. Captions and labels are clearly mentioned and do not interfere with the information that is being presented. Labeling is consistent across all graphs. Clever use of colors helps differentiate between different factors.

_Criteria_ | _Rating_
------------ | -------------
_It tells a story_ | 1
_Is tailored to an audience_ | 3
_Has a well-defined aim_ | 2
_Sets up a clear design framework_ | 1

**Overall Rating: 2**

The story is missing from this visual. The graph as a standalone element is unable to tell a story to the reader. Overall, the visual is too generic in terms of certain labels while at the same time has elements that cannot be understood by a casual audience. e.g.: the legends explaining the different bars can be understood only by a specific group of individuals (scientists etc.). The aim of the graph is also not clear. Even the caption of the graph does not convey clear information. Is it over past 50 or 65 years? Moreover, The creators have not followed a clear design framework. The use of different colors for individual bars on the graph leaves the user confused. The name of the website at the end is unnecessary. The word 'total' is repeated on the x-axis. The meaning of the legends is unclear or can be understood by a niche group of individuals.

**Visualization 3**

![Volcanic Eruptions vs Temprature](https://github.com/preranap1/Data_Viz_ClimateChangeNHumans/blob/master/Images/Visual5.png)

[Source](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/Aerosols/page3.php)

_Criteria_ | _Rating_
------------ | -------------
_It tells a story_ | 5
_Is tailored to an audience_ | 5
_Has a well-defined aim_ | 4
_Sets up a clear design framework_ | 5

**Overall Rating: 4**

This visual is able to tell a story effectively. It clearly explains the occurrence of different volcanic eruptions as well as the dip in temperature in that instance. Overall, the visual is tailor-made for individuals interested in understanding the impact of volcanic eruptions on temperature. Hence, it caters to a specific audience. The aim of the visual is clear, though the heading is missing. Proper labeling and captions help in this case. The creators have followed a clear design framework. Consistent use of colors and proper labeling improve the readability of the graphic. The three axes are clearly defined.

**Visualization 4**

![Impacts to Regional Climate Change](https://github.com/preranap1/Data_Viz_ClimateChangeNHumans/blob/master/Images/Visual4.jpg)

[Source](https://newscenter.lbl.gov/2016/01/20/assessing-the-impact-of-human-induced-climate-change/)

_Criteria_ | _Rating_
------------ | -------------
_It tells a story_ | 5
_Is tailored to an audience_ | 4
_Has a well-defined aim_ | 3
_Sets up a clear design framework_ | 5

**Overall Rating: 4**


While at first glance, the visual is not very clear, when the reader spends more time with it, they can understand the depth of information available. Overall, the visual can be easily understood by all. The use of language is professional but at the same time jargons are not used. The content of the visual is precise, concise and conveys the right meaning. The missing heading/title of the visual has a negative impact on the effectiveness of the visual. Also, the fact that the amount of information is a lot for a reader to take in does not help. For this reason, a concise title to the visual would have been very useful. The creators have followed a clear design framework. Colors are used to convey meaning. The icons used are well designed and depict the categories. The use of outlined and filled symbols is smart.

**Visualization 5**

[Temperature Difference between 1884 to 2018](https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature/)

_Criteria_ | _Rating_
------------ | -------------
_It tells a story_ | 5
_Is tailored to an audience_ | 5
_Has a well-defined aim_ | 5
_Sets up a clear design framework_ | 5

**Overall Rating: 5**


The visual is able to tell a story effectively of how temperatures have changed over the years from 1884 to 2018. The visual can be easily understood by all. The graphic relies on visual cues to drive the point. The aim of the graph is clear from its title. It uses interactivity in a clever and effortless way.  Colors are used to convey meaning clearly. The principle 'less is more' applies perfectly to this visual. Labels clearly convey meaning too.

**Conclusion**

In today's world, the sheer amount of data makes it difficult to interpret. Data visualizations play an important role in presenting data in a way that is interpretable and effective. It is the responsibility of the creator to ensure integrity of the data and the visualization is maintained. Great visualizations have the power to influence decisions, predict future trends and glean interesting relationships amongst categories/variables. Whiel it is important to maintain the aesthetic attributes of the graphic, data should always be the hero of the visualization.
