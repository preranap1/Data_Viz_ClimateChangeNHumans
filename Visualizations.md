# Analysis of Visualizations

Let us evaluate five visualizations based on the framework created. 

Visualizations are evaluated on a scale of 1 to 5. 

1 - Visualization completely misses on a particular criterion

2 - Visualization touches on the basic concept but is not able to do full justice

3 - Visualization covers some part of the framework but there is definitely room for improvement

4 - Some ambiguity but covers most of the requirements listed in the framework

5 - Visualization fulfills all requirements of a particular criteria listed in the framework

**Visualization 1**

[Bloomberg: What's really warming the world?](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-whats-warming-the-world/)

_Criteria 1: It tells a story_

Rating: 5

The bloomberg visualization does well in this criteria. The engaging content and narrative make the visualization memorable to the reader. It is interactive and is broken down in a way that keeps the reader interested. 

_Criteria 2: Is tailored to an audience_

Rating: 5

The audience of this visual would be the readers of Bloomberg Businessweek. Considering that they could be from different walks of life, the creators of the visualization have done a good job to explain concepts using simple words. We do not see many jargons that are difficult to understand. Short and precise copy over each graph explains what is happening perfectly. 

_Criteria 3: Has a well-defined aim_

Rating: 5

This visualization is data driven. Information about the data can be found in the explanation that follows the graphs. It aims to answer some questions and does a very good job at providing convincing arguments. 

_Criteria 4: Sets up a clear design framework_

Rating: 5

The designer follows design principles which makes the end product (the visualization) consistent in terms of design. Visual Hierarchy is maintained. The reader is first drawn to the question which is clearly answered by the graphs that follows. Interactivity in the graph lines further enhance user experience. Captions and labels are clearly mentioned and do not interfere with the information that is being presented. Labeling is consistent across all graphs. Clever use of colors help differentiate between different factors.

Overall Rating: 5

**Visualization 2**

![Climate change explained in 10 graphics](/Users/preranapatil/Documents/GitHub/Data_Viz_ClimateChangeNHumans//Images/Visual2.png)

[Source](https://www.globalchange.gov/browse/multimedia/%EF%BF%BCseparating-human-and-natural-influences-climate)

_Criteria 1: It tells a story_

Rating: 4

This visual explains the context and the reader in a glance can understand the comparisons made. However, the story telling element does not come through.

_Criteria 2: Is tailored to an audience_

Rating: 4

The audience of this visual would be the readers of US Global Change Research Program. The visualization uses a language that is easy and understood by all. We do not see many jargons that are difficult to understand though the language seems a little too generic.

_Criteria 3: Has a well-defined aim_

Rating: 5

The aim of the graphic is clearly defined in the caption. Also, the graph does justice in explaining exactly what the caption states.

_Criteria 4: Sets up a clear design framework_

Rating: 5

Visual Hierarchy is maintained in the graphic. Labels are proerly defined with clear distinction based on different colors used. The x and y axis is properly labelled too. 

Overall Rating: 4.5

**Visualization 3**

![Human vs. Natural Contributions to Global Warming](/Users/preranapatil/Documents/GitHub/Data_Viz_ClimateChangeNHumans//Images/Visual3.jpg)

_Criteria 1: It tells a story_

Rating: 1

The story is missing from the visual. The graph as a standalone element is unable to tell a story to the reader.

_Criteria 2: Is tailored to an audience_

Rating: 3

Overall, the visual is too generic in terms of certain labels while at the same time has elements that cannot be understood by a casual audience. e.g.: the legends explaining the different bars can be understood by a specific group of individuals only.

_Criteria 3: Has a well-defined aim_

Rating: 2

The aim of the graph is not clear. Even the caption of the graph does not convey clear information. is it over past 50 or 65 years? The aim of the graph is very generic and not well-thought-through.

_Criteria 4: Sets up a clear design framework_

Rating: 1

The creators have not followed a clear design framework. The use of many colors leaves the user confused. The name of the website at the end is unecessary. The word 'total' is repeated on the x-axis. The meaning of the legends is unclear or can be understood by a niche group of individuals.
