# Data Visualization Framework

This is my  attempt at understanding Visualizations.

After going through different blogs, online courses and other reading material I came up with my own framework that I keep in mind while creating data visualizations.

Page 1 defines what 'effective visualization' means and specifies the framework for evaluation.

Page then evaluates five visualizations based on the framework developed. For consistency, the topic of the visualization is common which is Climate Change.

I then attempt to Replicate a visualization - Warming Stripes by using python.
